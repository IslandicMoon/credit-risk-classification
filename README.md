# credit-risk-classification

Overview
In this dataset we review different individuals credit risk factors in order to create an accurate predictor for future applications. 

Results
With the prediction model we were able to get a high accuracy reading for healthy loan applications and while the high risk loan was at an 84% it could be improved. 

Our logistic regression model provided the same results which could mean that our model needs additional data for more accuracy. 

Summary
Overall the models provided high accuracy for predicting a candidates credit risk, but it is important to consider potential factors, which were unavailable, that the model is unable to consider (i.e. credit score) which could provide further accuracy if narrowed down in a way to be interrupted for the model.
